"There was coffee station down the lobby which was inconvenient since we had to go down eveytime we needed coffee in the mornin.

The staffs are welcoming and very accommodating. And perfect location.

"In my opinion hotel did not look anything like pictures. Maybe there are some rooms that look like this but ours did not.

Staff was great, hotel was clean.

"The wait time to check in was unbearable. It appeared only one person was working on reception - until when she had a problem, another person was called to help. Suddenly it meant 2 people were helping the person in front of us check in. We had to ask if perhaps it would be possible for one person to come check us in and get our luggage out of storage.
The second room we were moved to was on the 8th floor and quite noisy. It was a wheelchair accessible room, there was nowhere to put our things in the bathroom except on the floor. The shower faucet came off in our hands the first time we tried to use it. We persevered, manually working the controls as we really didn't want to move a 2nd time.
The hotel was under going maintenance - the numbering system in the lift was difficult to follow - paper numbers taped over the buttons that didnt correspond to the screen in the lift.

The first room we had was great, on 12th floor, great views, quiet. We were moved to a second room because there had been some kind of leak over the bath, there was a hole in the roof and grey plaster stuff had leaked all over the bath. The response to inspect was was very fast. The original reception staff were great and moved our luggage to storage efficiently and did a pre check in for us.

"The room was a lot smaller than anticipated. Change of bedding and towels/ room service is only available upon request. The location is slightly away from the beach and other attractions.

The room was clean, the staff is friendly, and they are able to resolve any issue that we have. We are able to retrieve our lost item after room service

"it wasn’t set up for more than a one night stay. We had a mini kitchen in our room that didn’t have paper towels or dish soap.
They only do cleaning on request and they don’t replace essentials like toilet paper. The cleaning staff did not do the dishes either.

Great location!
Prime location in the heart of Waikiki close to everything. The staff was super friendly and very accommodating. The facility itself was cool and beachy.

"still overpriced for what it is. Bathrooms had nowhere to hang your towels after you shower.

"it wasn’t great value. very expensive for what it was. bathrooms need an update. not super clean either. when we checked in, we arrived at 14.45 and the check in girls offered to check us in early (15 mins) free of charge in exchange for a review ?? so we opted to wait for 15 minutes instead

location was great, nice spacious rooms

"The room and the hotel are a bit outdated. The bathroom barn doors are absolutely useless, and the shower enclosure is ridiculously small, hence the water after taking shower is everywhere. The bed is quite uncomfortable, and the balcony concrete slab is cracked with concrete chipping off in multiple locations.

The location is very convenient and is close to everything. The staff was super friendly and attentive!

"No kettle in room

Friendly welcome after a long flight; staff were great.
Comfortable beds, room was small  with no balcony or view but just fine for a short break.
The pool area and happy hour were an added bonus!

"A free breakfast would be a nice addition, room service was limited. The road noise was so loud and there was often homeless people yelling at all hours of the night.

The staff was extremely kind and helpful, the hotel is super close to waikiki and public transportation. The hotel room was clean and the balcony had chairs.

The location, the hotel is located in Kalakaua Av. which is great.

"The pool was way smaller than it looks on all of the website shots! It doesn’t hold more than 10 people at a time.
Definitely no laps or splashing!!
Difficult for families for sure (no spa either due to Covid)

Room was nice. Quite basic but good for the cost.

"The hotel is being renovated and there was construction noise next to our room. Management should not have booked us on a floor with active reconstruction. Management's response to my complaints were less than adequate.

Great location. Close to the beach. There was a pool and a poolside bar.

"The balcony was in disrepair and was closed shut while others had access to their balconies.  There was nothing extra in the room including towels and a real blanket. There was only a sheet and a thin blanket.  The air conditioning remote needed to be reset and was hard to work with. The bathroom looks like it needs to be renovated with the drywall bulging and cracking from the steam.  The ice machine in the lobby holds a total of 2 cups of ice and then it's out for the rest of the day. The backup ice machine is in the parking garage. The coffee was cold in the lobby and no coffee in the rooms.

The room was clean. The hotel was simple.
