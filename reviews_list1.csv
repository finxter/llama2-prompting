review
Very friendly staff and cozy facility. Minor upgrade needed in the room and only reason 4 stars I reviewed because the construction right outside the building. Upstairs and next door room noise penetrated the wall easily if you are noise sensitive person a sleeping earbud or ear plugs might be needed.
"Our stay at Hotel La Croix was truly exceptional. Attentive staff who made us feel right at home. The receptionists were very helpful. The room was clean, and bright, Mhila has a really lovely character, and doing the cleaning with a smile."
"The atmosphere is warm, and the staff is friendly and attentive. The staff Mhila catered to our every need ensuring that our stay was as comfortable as possible. A very convenient location, and outstanding service! Can't wait to return again."
"Clean and well maintained. The staff went above and beyond at all times, and suggesting restaurants. The room service Mhila was very kind, and on time. A truly relaxing and enjoyable experience. I can't wait to return on my next visit, Thanks."
The Hotel LaCroix is a wonderful value for a hotel in the Waikiki area. The location is excellent. Easy walking distance to shops and restaurants. The rooms are clean. You can tell some updating of floors and some furniture was needed but not enough of an issue to not stay there. The bathroom in our room was updated and in great shop. Very strong water pressure from the shower. I would stay there again if I have a chance to visit Honolulu again. Very friendly hotel staff.
"Mark, greeted me as soon as I arrived in the loby area. He provided optimal customer service and perfect directions. He and the clerk made check in so easy it was the least stressful part of my business trip. Additional staff for check-in and valet parking were also very helpful and showed pure Aloha from arrival to departure. Mahalo nui Mark and staff."
"Wow!!! What a great way to spend a few days on Oahu. Kudos to Megan for all of her fantastic recommendations upon making our reservations with her. She is definitely a pleasant and knowledgeable asset to the wonderful staff of Hotel La Croix. The location is amazing and the views from our room deck were very nice. Make sure you get access to the Monkeypod room. You can walk to all things Waikiki from here. The beach, legendary healing stones and a plethora of eating options from ice cream to tappenyaki. Easy and affordable local bus ride got us over to the zoo, aquarium and Diamond Head crater hiking trail for our sunrise stroll up the iconic landmark. So stoked on the time we spent and where we spent it. Thank you for the Aloha!!!!"
"We did not have a great experience at this hotel. 1st of all, there is a lot of false advertising online with this place. (We booked through priceline). They make the pool look huge (it is actually tiny) and the rooms nice and furnished in the pictures (it resembled a motel- they were no pictures on the walls, just the very basics in the room). Parking was $45 per day (very expensive and not stated when we booked). The 1st night there was no hot water. We saw a tiny cockroach in the bathroom. All the communication with the front desk was through text. You had to schedule service to the room. We scheduled service one day and they never came to clean the room. The one positive I would give this place is the staff was very friendly, otherwise I would not recommend this hotel."
"Vincent, was such a pleasure to be around! He was very friendly and accommodating when I was visiting the pool deck. Such a beautiful hotel and the staff is extremely proffesional and welcoming! Thank you so much to everyone who made this a great experience!"
"Everything good! you should try the service here, but there is no microwave and boiling water in the room, you need to bring an iron. The aircon works well and is close to the central area. you can walk to the beach about 15 minutes"
